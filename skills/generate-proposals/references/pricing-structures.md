<overview>
Tiered pricing increases conversion by 32% (Bidsketch research). This reference provides guidance on structuring three-tier pricing, calculating ROI, and positioning each tier effectively.
</overview>

<tiered_pricing_psychology>
**Why Three Tiers Work:**

1. **Anchoring**: Premium tier makes Recommended feel reasonable
2. **Self-selection**: Clients choose based on their budget/needs
3. **Reduces negotiation**: "Which tier?" vs "Can we get a discount?"
4. **Increases average deal size**: Some choose Premium when they'd have accepted less

**The "Goldilocks Effect":**
- Essential = "Too little" (but perfect for budget-conscious)
- Recommended = "Just right" (majority choose this)
- Premium = "More than enough" (for committed clients)

**Research findings:**
- 32% more sales with tiered pricing (Bidsketch)
- 60-70% choose the middle option
- 20-25% choose premium when well-positioned
- Wide price range increases "bulls-eye" match

<roi_calculation_framework>
**Select 1-2 ROI angles based on solution type:**

<solution_type_to_roi_mapping>
| Solution Type | Primary Angle | Secondary Angle |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|
| Lead Gen / Sales Automation | Revenue Impact | Time Savings |
| Process Automation | Time Savings | Cost Avoidance |
| Content Automation | Time Savings | Quality/Consistency |
| Data/Analytics | Decision Quality | Time Savings |
| Customer Service | Cost Avoidance | Customer Satisfaction |
| Internal Tools | Time Savings | Error Reduction |
| Integration Projects | Time Savings | Data Accuracy |
</solution_type_to_roi_mapping>

<angle name="Time Savings" universal="true">
**Use for:** Almost any automation project. Most universally applicable.

| Activity | Hours/Week Before | Hours/Week After | Annual Savings |
|----------|-------------------|------------------|----------------|
| [Manual task 1] | X | Y | (X-Y) × 52 × $hourly_rate |
| [Manual task 2] | X | Y | (X-Y) × 52 × $hourly_rate |
| **Total** | | | **$[sum]/year** |

**Formula:** Hours saved × hourly rate × 52 weeks = Annual value
**Client-friendly:** "Saves [X] hours/week = $[Y]/year in labor costs"
</angle>

<angle name="Revenue Impact">
**Use for:** Lead generation, sales automation, conversion optimization.

| Metric | Current | Projected | Impact |
|--------|---------|-----------|--------|
| [Key input metric] | X | Y | +Z |
| [Conversion/success rate] | X% | Y% | +Z points |
| [Value per success] | $X | $X | - |
| **Monthly impact** | - | - | Calculation |

**Adapt metrics to solution:**
- Lead gen: Leads → Qualified → Meetings → Deals
- E-commerce: Visitors → Cart → Checkout → Orders
- SaaS: Trials → Activated → Converted → Retained
- Service: Inquiries → Quotes → Closed → Recurring

**Client-friendly:** "One additional [success metric] = $[X] → Payback in [Y] successes"
</angle>

<angle name="Cost Avoidance">
**Use for:** Replacing expensive alternatives, avoiding hires, reducing vendor costs.

| Alternative | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| Hire dedicated resource | $X/mo | $Y/yr |
| Use external agency/vendor | $X/mo | $Y/yr |
| Current manual process cost | $X/mo | $Y/yr |
| SaaS tool alternative | $X/mo | $Y/yr |

**Client-friendly:** "Investment of $[X] vs $[Y]/year alternative = [Z]% savings"
</angle>

<angle name="Quality/Consistency">
**Use for:** Content automation, data processing, compliance.

| Metric | Before | After | Value |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Error rate | X% | Y% | Cost of errors × reduction |
| Rework rate | X% | Y% | Rework hours × rate |
| Consistency score | X% | Y% | Brand/compliance value |
| Output volume | X/period | Y/period | Capacity increase |

**Client-friendly:** "Reduces errors by [X]% = $[Y] saved in rework/corrections"
</angle>

<angle name="Speed/Time-to-Market">
**Use for:** Process automation, approval workflows, development tools.

| Metric | Before | After | Value |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Process cycle time | X days | Y days | Opportunity cost of delay |
| Time to first response | X hours | Y minutes | Competitive advantage |
| Approval turnaround | X days | Y hours | Revenue acceleration |

**Client-friendly:** "[X]% faster delivery = earlier revenue capture"
</angle>

<angle name="Decision Quality">
**Use for:** Analytics, dashboards, reporting, AI insights.

| Metric | Before | After | Value |
|--------|--------|-------|-------|
| Data freshness | X days | Real-time | Better decisions |
| Analysis time | X hours | Y minutes | Faster pivots |
| Insight coverage | X% of data | Y% of data | Fewer blind spots |

**Client-friendly:** "Make decisions [X]× faster with [Y]% more data visibility"
</angle>
</roi_calculation_framework>

<payback_period_calculation>
**Formula:**
```
Payback Period (months) = Investment ÷ Monthly Value Created
```

**Example:**
- Investment: $2,500 (Recommended tier)
- Time savings: $800/month (20 hrs × $40/hr)
- Revenue impact: $1,500/month (3 extra qualified leads × $500 value)
- Total monthly value: $2,300
- Payback: $2,500 ÷ $2,300 = 1.1 months

**Always express payback in client-friendly terms:**
- "Pays for itself in [X] months"
- "One closed deal covers the investment"
- "Equivalent to hiring someone at $[X]/month for [Y] months"
</payback_period_calculation>

<payment_terms>
**Standard milestone-based:**

| Milestone | Percentage | When |
|-----------|------------|------|
| Kick-off | 50% | Upon signing |
| Delivery | 50% | Upon go-live |

**Alternative for larger projects:**

| Milestone | Percentage | When |
|-----------|------------|------|
| Kick-off | 40% | Upon signing |
| Mid-build | 30% | At review checkpoint |
| Delivery | 30% | Upon go-live |

**Pilot/POC option:**
For larger engagements or risk-averse clients:
- Phase 1 (POC): $[reduced scope] — prove the concept
- Phase 2 (Full): $[full scope] — expand upon success

**Never:**
- 100% upfront (too risky for client)
- 100% upon delivery (too risky for you)
- Open-ended milestone dates
</payment_terms>

<ongoing_costs_transparency>
Always disclose post-launch costs clearly. **Ask the user which apply to this project.**
