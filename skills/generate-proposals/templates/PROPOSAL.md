PROPOSAL TEMPLATE - Solution-Type Agnostic
==========================================
This template works for ANY AI/automation project. When filling:
1. Choose the right ROI angle based on solution type (see references/pricing-structures.md)
2. Adapt competitors based on solution category (see references/competitive-positioning.md)
3. Include only the ongoing costs relevant to this specific project
4. Customize the "Sample in Action" section to match the solution type

SOLUTION TYPE → ROI ANGLE MAPPING:
- Lead Gen / Sales Automation → Revenue Impact + Time Savings
- Process Automation → Time Savings + Cost Avoidance
- Content Automation → Time Savings + Quality/Consistency
- Data/Analytics → Decision Quality + Time Savings
- Customer Service → Cost Avoidance + Customer Satisfaction
- Internal Tools → Time Savings + Error Reduction
- Integration Projects → Time Savings + Data Accuracy
