**Status:** Planned (not yet implemented)

This workflow will help refine and improve existing proposals.
</overview>

<process>
For now, read the existing proposal and manually apply improvements based on the essential principles in SKILL.md.

**Future implementation will include:**
1. Proposal gap analysis against template
2. Executive summary strength scoring
3. Pricing tier optimization
4. Competitive positioning enhancement
5. ROI calculation refinement
</process>

<workaround>
To improve an existing proposal manually:

1. **Read the proposal** and compare to `templates/PROPOSAL.md`
2. **Check essentials:**
   - Does executive summary have: problem, solution, metric, investment, CTA?
   - Are there 3 pricing tiers with Recommended marked?
   - Is competitive positioning included?
   - Are ongoing costs disclosed?
   - Is ROI/payback calculated?

3. **Apply SKILL.md essential principles:**
   - Business value over technical depth
   - Tiered pricing psychology
   - Risk mitigation upfront
   - "What" not "How" in solution section

4. **Regenerate sections** that are weak using the templates and references.
</workaround>
