**This workflow is a future stub.** It is not yet implemented. When invoked, inform the user that UX compliance review is planned but not yet available, and suggest using the `create-ux-plan` workflow instead.

<objective>
Audit a built implementation against an existing UX-DESIGN-PLAN.md to identify deviations — missing states, incorrect hierarchy, accessibility gaps, and behavioral mismatches.
</objective>

<planned_scope>
- Compare implemented components against spec'd component states
- Verify accessibility attributes match spec
- Check responsive behavior at each tier
- Validate data states (loading, empty, error, success) exist
- Produce a compliance report with deviation severity ratings
</planned_scope>
